# MSL

This is an MSL module, its source code is from vt, I just made some modifications. and now it works with devine. I just want to contribute to devine and get more people to use devine.

If you encounter an email or password error, there is no good solution. You can add httpx and unannotation line 47 of the MSL__init__.py.

Finally, thank you to Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Zackmark for their help.
